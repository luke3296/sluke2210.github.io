        <div class="article-content markdown-body"><p>AI is a field  with a lot of histroy and lot of applications. Many techniques such as state space search grew out of attempts in AI to make intellegent programs. Thinking about thinking is a difficult task as you cannot remove yourself from the thought process. Yet many AI programs take there inspiration from human resoning processes. There are three ways we can think about how humans think</p>
<ol>
<li>Introspection - trying to catch our own thoughts as they go by</li>
<li>phycoogy experiments - by observing other people and how they act in an expereiment</li>
<li>brain imageing - there by observing how the brain responds to certain stimuli and</li>
</ol>
<p>More broadly the field of cognative science uses AI techniques as well as traditional science to try uncover the inner workings of intellegence.</p>
<p>my personal  view is that intellgence is a emergent effect of sufficechntly complex systems with a goal and exsists on a spectrum . For example a dog is intellegent but<br />
There have been many attempts to make intellegent programs but the holy grail of AGI is still out of reach. Some of these techniques include</p>
<ol>
<li>logic based approaches - use rules of logic as to solve a problem stated in logical notation. This technique has traditionally domniated as we view logic as an essential part of intelegence itself. These can also thought of as 'rationalist approaches'.</li>
<li>evoltionary approaches - create a generation of programs that can repoduce themselves keeping desireble traits while undesireble traits 'die out'. The idea being that natruel selection applied to programs can bring about intellegence. They use genetic algorithms</li>
<li>connectionist approaches that try to understand intellegence through the connection of nurons. The predominat work in the field is the mapping of the conectome of C elegans.</li>
<li>Agent based approaches, modelleing intellegence through the interactions of a sociaety agents in the hope that they are more intellegent than the sum of there parts</li>
<li>others...</li>
</ol>
<p>More recently techniques in Machine Leanring have been applied to AI problems such as computer vision and Natruel langugae processing. These are invaluvble techniques in the contruction of an otellegfent systems. Deep nural networks can be used as blackboxes that perfrom complex function for example turning images into textual representatations and vis vera. DNN's are determinist in the sense that provided with the same input they will produce the same result. I beleive a truly intellegent program would have to include some stochatic process otherwise there just very impressive mappings.</p>
<p>The first logic based approaches automated theorm solvers<br />
