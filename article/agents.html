<p>An agent is anything that acts. It can be a piece of software or purley conceptual. we can model differnet types of agents to perfrom different types of tasks.</p>
<ol>
<li>Agents are automnous / semi autommous meaning they are able to act without perfect knowledge of the enviroment</li>
<li>Agents are situated in an enviroment (where enviroment is anything that isn't the agent including other agents in multiagent systems) an can perceive some of its enviroment</li>
<li>Agents are iterational with other agents forming a soceity of agents that can work on aparticular task</li>
<li>the society of agents is structured. that is each agent perfomrs one specific task using its own perception of enviroments and its own set of actions. It works with other agents in a sructured way to perform problem solving</li>
<li>Intelegence is an emergent effect that can come out of the iteractions of a society of agents.</li>
